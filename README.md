📊 Data Analytics Project — README
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end Data Analytics workflow that includes loading a dataset in Python, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), cleaning data, running SQL queries on PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server, building an interactive Power BI dashboard, and delivering insights through a report and a professional presentation using Gamma. The project highlights key analytical skills relevant to business analytics and data-driven decision making.
________________________________________
📂 Dataset
•	The dataset is in CSV / Excel format and contains structured data related to a business domain (e.g., customer transactions, product details, sales, reviews).
•	It was first loaded and processed in Python, cleaned and prepared for analysis.
•	The cleaned data was then imported into SQL databases (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server) for deeper querying and aggregation.

🧠 Project Workflow / Steps
1️⃣ Dataset Loading (Python)
•	Loaded the dataset using pandas
•	Performed initial checks for structure, columns, datatypes, and summary statistics
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Conducted exploratory analysis to understand patterns, trends, and distributions
•	Visualized relationships between variables using charts and summary statistics
3️⃣ Data Cleaning
•	Handled missing values and duplicates
•	Treated outliers as needed
•	Standardized and formatted categorical fields
•	Prepared a clean dataset for SQL ingestion and reporting
4️⃣ SQL Analysis
•	Imported cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server
•	Ran queries to create summary tables and metrics such as:
o	Aggregated totals (e.g., sales, revenue, count)
o	Group-by analyses (e.g., category, region, customer segment)
o	Joins and complex filters
o	KPI calculations for reporting
5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard
•	Developed an interactive dashboard to showcase insights
•	Included visuals such as:
o	KPI cards
o	Bar charts and line charts
o	Pie / donut charts
o	Trend analysis
•	Added slicers for interactive exploration (e.g., by category, segment, time period)
